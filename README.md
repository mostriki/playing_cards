# Playing Cards

#### An independent project using Ruby to build a playing card application, 03.12.2018

#### By Riki Montgomery

## Description

The goal of this project was to write a set of classes that represent the feeling of playing with a deck of cards. You should be able to shuffle the deck and deal out one card at a time until the deck is empty.

## Further Exploration

The classes could be improved by adding card colors to Deck or giving Dealer more features. If the application were a little larger, I might discover more ways to break up the application into new and different classes. I would add players, a card class, and even an automatic card shuffler to shuffle the deck for the dealer.
